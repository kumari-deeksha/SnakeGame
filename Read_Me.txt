This is a Snake Game in which I have used pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
When a snake will eat his food, and when he ate food another food will be displayed on a random place within the screen of the game.
This game includes showing Player's Score on the screen as well as HiScore of other players who have played this game earlier.
When a player touches any Game boundary it's game will be over and an alert will be poped up on the Screen of his desktop to tell he can start his game again, 
I have also included various game sounds, when the snake eat food a sound will be played and when a player dies another sound will be played, and in overall game time there will be another sund that will be played.
As, sound play an important role in any game so all these sounds will make this game an interesting game for anyone.
